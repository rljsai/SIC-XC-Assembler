# SIC-XC-Assembler
The assembler for the SIC/XE machine is implemented in C++ language and operates
on a two-pass logic. This report details the functionality and processes involved
in both passes.
The following features are implemented in this assembler:
1. Expressions
2. Literals
3. Symbol Defining Statements
4. Control section<br>
<P>This project implements an assembler that supports SIC/XE instructions. The
assembler includes all the instructions. It supports Control Sections.<br>
The instruction formats supported by SIC/XE :

## Working of Assembler
### PASS1:
* In the initial pass, the assembler assigns addresses to symbols and instructions.
* Symbols, literals, and external references are stored in their respective tables.
* Processing for expressions and EQU statements is conducted.
* Errors are flagged for forward references in EQU expressions and for invalid opcodes or assembler directives.

### PASS2:
* The second pass focuses on the assembly of instructions.
* It reads input from the intermediate file and corresponding tables.
* Error messages are generated if discrepancies are found.
* The assembler creates a listing file and object program based on the assembled instructions.


## Instructions to Use the Assembler:
### clone the repository
```
  git clone https://github.com/rljsai/SIC-XC-Assembler.git
```
### contains several files each descriptions are given below
* sic-assemblermain.cpp --> To run Assembler
* sic-assembler-passes.cpp --> contains the code for PASS 1 & 2 and data structures and functions used
* input.txt --> The code for assembly is to be written into this file
* organising.txt --> contains assembly program in an organising way
* Intermediatefile.txt --> contains instructions and itâ€™s address assigned after PASS 1
* errors.txt --> contains errors in PASS 1 &2 if any
* tables.txt --> contains symbol tables and literal tables
* listingfile.txt --> contains assembled instructions
* objectcode.txt --> contains object program
